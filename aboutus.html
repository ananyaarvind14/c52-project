    I was born in Columbus, Indiana in the USA for 8 years and then I had the apportunity to live in Pune Maharashtra in India and I was able to spend time with my extended family for 3 years now I live in Oakville, Ontario in Canada. 
    I love to build legos, study science and math, and code. 
    I love to spend time on the beach and I have 2 loving parents and a fun and outgoing younger brother. 
    My parents have gifted me the opportunity to live in 3 different parts of te world and I have been very thankful for that. 
    In the places I have lived in I have learned and studied the cultures and have had the opportunity to interact and learn all about how people have lived.
